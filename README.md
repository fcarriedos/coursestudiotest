This is a test project for Course.Studio by Francisco Carriedo.

Technically speaking, this is just a dummy blog app using ReactJS + NextJS project + NodeJS + TypeScript project.

The project covers all the functional and technical requirements in the specification received:

  * List (read) all posts

  * Delete existing posts


The technical requirements were:

 * Backend:
    * NodeJS + TypeScript
    * Persistence Layer (MongoDB)
    * Integration with third party APIs
    * Code hosting at GitHub: https://github.com/fcarriedos/coursestudiotest
    * Application hosting at Heroku: https://coursestudiotest.herokuapp.com/
 * Frontend: React + NextJS


Suggesting next features for further study:

 * Add a warning when leaving update without saving
 * Authentication
 * Pagination
 * CDN for static content
 * Integrate a logging framework (Winston?)
 * Platform wide logging using Sumologic sink
 * Deployment pipeline (dev, staging, production)
